# Queries

Queries are the core data request interface for any Meetup Web Platform app.
They are primarily generated by application Routes to indicate what data each
one needs from the API when it is active. However, they can be used for any
request to the API, and are therefore used for POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests
as well.

At a high level, you can think of a Query as a JSON-encoded API request, including
all request parameters, the endpoint URI, and any metadata properties like
custom headers

## Spec

### Query object

A Query is just a plain object with the following shape:

```js
{
  ref: string,
  endpoint: string,
  list?: {
    dynamicRef: string,
    merge?: {
      sort: (Object, Object) => number,
      idTest: (Object, Object) => boolean,
    }
  },
  params?: object,
  type?: string, // DEPRECATED
  meta?: {
    flags?: string[],
    method?: string
    variants: {
      [string]: string | number | string[] | number[],  // e.g. { experiment1: chapterId }
    },
    metaRequestHeaders?: string[],
  },
}
```

**Example**

```js
{
  ref: 'foobar',
  endpoint: 'foo/bar',
  params: {
    memberId: 1234,
  },
  type: 'foo',  // generally not needed
  meta: {
    flags: ['thisflag', 'thatflag'],
    method: 'get',  // generally not needed
    variants: {
      'my-member-experiment': '1234',  // memberId - MUST BE STRING (e.g. `memberId.toString()`)
      'my-group-experiment': '5678',    // chapterId
    },
	metaRequestHeaders: ['unread-messages'],
  },
}
```

#### `ref`

A unique string reference to the query. The `ref` is used to uniquely identify
the query _and_ uniquely assign the resulting API data to Redux state at
`state.api[ref]`.

#### `endpoint`

The Meetup API endpoint as a URL pathname, e.g. `/members/123456`. Note that
this URL should not include any parameter placeholders like `/:urlname` - the
values should be filled in as needed.

#### `params`

The parameters that should be passed to the API either in the querystring (for
GET requests) or the request body (for POST requests).

#### `type`

A one-word description of the 'data type' expected to be returned by the API
for this query. This information is used on the server to further process the
data for certain data types like `'group'` objects, which will receive special
duotone photo URLs in addition to the standard photo URLs provided by the API.

The `type` should be the same regardless of whether the returned data is an
array or a singleton.

**Type examples**

- `group`
- `member`
- `event`
- `comment`
- feature-specific objects like `home`, `conversations`

#### `meta`

##### `flags`

An array of feature flag (Runtime Flag) names that should be returned
alongside the main request.

#### `metaRequestHeaders`

The `metaRequestHeaders` property is in reference to `X-Meta-Request-Headers` in the
[meetup api](https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/#meta-headers).  The response for each
header passed in will be in `REF.meta`, converted from `snake-case` to `camelCase`.


##### `method`

You can force the query to be sent with a particular HTTP method by specifying
it here as a string: `get`, `post`, `delete`, or `patch`. Note that
you should never try to make a request that contains multiple queries with
different `method`s.

Alternatively, you can use method-specific action creators to automatically
assingn the method and make the request for individual requests.

##### `variants`

You can request variant names for particular experiments with particular
contexts by populating `meta.variants` with an object containing keys that are
experiment names and values that are string IDs (member ID or chapter ID
depending on the experiment).

### Query Response

A query response is also a plain object

```js
{
  ref: string,
  value: any,
  type?: string,
  meta?: {
    flags?: string[],
    variants?: {
      [string]: {  // experiment
        [string]: string  // context: variant
      },
    },
  },
}
```

#### `meta`

#### `variants`

If a query contains a `meta.variants` request, the query response _might not
contain a corresponding `variants` response_ if the variants service fails -
you must test for the existence of `meta.variants` before reading from it.

## Usage

In general, queries start as the payload of an `API_REQ` action, which will
generate responses that are applied to Redux state.

### Action creation

You should always use the action creators in `apiActionCreators` to dispatch
API requests. Each action creator takes a single query or an array of queries
as its first argument, and an optional `meta` argument

#### `get`

```js
import * as api from 'meetup-web-platform/lib/actions/apiActionCreators';

const getQuery = {
  endpoint: 'ny-tech/members',
  ref: 'newMember',
};
const getAction = api.get(getQuery);
```

#### `post`/`patch`

```js
import * as api from 'meetup-web-platform/lib/actions/apiActionCreators';

const postQuery = {
  endpoint: 'ny-tech/members',
  ref: 'newMember',
  params: { name, bio },
};
const postAction = api.post(postQuery);
const patchAction = api.patch(postQuery);
```

#### `delete`

```js
import * as api from 'meetup-web-platform/lib/actions/apiActionCreators';

const deleteQuery = {
  endpoint: 'ny-tech/members/123456',
  ref: 'deletedMember',
  params: { id },
};
const deleteAction = api.del(deleteQuery);  // note `api.del` not `api.delete` because `delete` is a keywork
```

### Query dispatch

Use Redux's `store.dispatch` or `bindActionCreators` to dispatch the query
actions.

#### `Promise` interface for dispatched queries

An API request action object always has a type of `API_REQ`, and it will always
have a `meta` property that contains a `request` property corresponding to the
current status of the request. The Promise will resolve on a successful API
request, and `reject` on a 400/500 error from the fetch call.

This property can be accessed by the `dispatch` _caller_ by consuming the return
value of the `dispatch()` call, which is the dispatched action itself. The
caller can then attach response handlers in `action.meta.request.then()` Promise
callbacks.

**Example using `mapDispatchToProps`**

```js
// Example.jsx
import { SubmissionError } from 'redux-form';
import * as api from 'meetup-web-platform/lib/actions/apiActionCreators';

function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
  return bindActionCreators({ post: api.post }, dispatch);
}

class Example extends React.Component {
  onSubmit() {
    const formQuery = { ... };
    const apiRequest = this.props.post(formQuery); // this triggers the POST, returns dispatched action object
    const { request } = apiRequest.meta;
    request.then(response => {
      const formResponse = response;
      // validate the form, throw `SubmissionError` as needed
    })
  }
}
```

### Sync middleware

When query actions are dispatched, the sync middleware will generate a
corresponding `fetch` to the API proxy endpoint of the app server, e.g.

```
GET /mu_api?queries=[query, ...]
```

**API response array returned as JSON from app server**

The app server API proxy endpoint will respond with an array of Query responses.

```js
[
  {
    ref: string,
    value: {},
    error?: {},
    type?: string,
    meta?: {},  // data returned from API separate from `value`
  },
  // ...
]
```

The fetchQueries function will then filter these Query Response objects into
separate `successes` and `errors` arrays, where each array element is an object
containing the original `query` object and its corresponding `response`:

```js
{
  successes: [{ query, response }, ...],
  errors: [{ query, response }, ...],
}
```

The sync middleware will read these two arrays and generate a separate
`API_RESP_SUCCESS` or `API_RESP_ERROR` action for each response object.

#### Request failure - `API_RESP_FAIL`

If the `fetch` fails entirely, no responses will be delivered to the
application. Instead, an `API_RESP_FAIL` action will be dispatched with an
`Error` payload.

#### Request complete - `API_RESP_COMPLETE`

After all Query Responses have been dispatched, the sync middleware will
dispatch a final `API_RESP_COMPLETE` action.

### Platform `api` reducer - `state.api`

When `API_REQ` is first dispatched, the platform `api` reducer will add each
Query's `ref` to an `inFlight` array. This property can be inspected to
determine whether a particular ref is 'in-flight', e.g.

```js
mapStateToProps(state) {
  return {
    isLoading: state.api.inFlight.includes(myRef),
  };
}
```

When the API responds, the platform reducer will read the `API_RESP_SUCCESS`
and `API_RESP_ERROR` values into `state.api[ref]` for each response and clear
the corresponding `ref` from `state.api.inFlight`.

**Redux state after being processed by `API_RESP_SUCCESS` action**

```js
{
  [ref]: {
    ref,
    type?,
    value: {},
    meta?: {}
  },
  // ...
}
```

**Redux state after being processed by `API_RESP_ERROR` action**

```js
{
  [ref]: {
    ref,
    type?,
    error: error,
    meta?: {}
  },
  // ...
}
```

If `API_RESP_FAIL` is dispatched, `state.api` will not receive new data,
but will instead populate `state.fail` with an `Error` object describing the
the failed call.

**Redux state after being processed by `API_RESP_FAIL` action**

```js
{
  fail: Error,
  // ...  all other data is stale but technically still valid
}
```

### Route query functions

```js
// see description for docs about object argument
({ params, isExact, url, path, location }) => Query
```

One of the primary uses for queries is to load route-specific data from the
API. The application will automatically generate these queries by calling
particular 'query creator' functions that are assigned to application routes,
producing a fully-qualified 'query' object from the routing state input.

Route query creator functions have two requirements:

1. They are assigned as _props_ of React Router `route`s .The `query` prop can
be either a single query creator function or an array of functions
2. They are pure functions that take a single object argument constructed from the
[`match` object from React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/match),
which includes `params` extracted from the URL) with an additional `location`
property corresponding to the current
[React Router `location`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/location).

More info in the [Routing docs](./Routing.md).

#### Example query function

```js
export const GROUP_REF = 'group';
function groupQuery({ params, location }) {
	const { urlname } = params;

	return {
		ref: GROUP_REF,
		type: 'group',
		endpoint: `/${urlname}`,
		params: {
			fields: ['event_sample']
		},
	};
}

// applied to a route:

const groupRoute = {
	path: '/:urlname',
	query: groupQuery, // or [groupQuery, ...<other queries>]
	component: GroupContainer,
};
```

## React recipes

### GET (lazy loading)

On page load, the application will automatically collect any query objects
generated by the query functions you assign to your routes. However, if you need
to make another GET request, you can manually dispatch an API request using the
`get` action creator from
[`apiActionCreators`](../src/actions/apiActionCreators.js).

```js
// Example.jsx
import * as api from 'meetup-web-platform/lib/actions/apiActionCreators';

function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
  return bindActionCreators({ get: api.get }, dispatch);
}

class Example extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    const lazyQuery = {
      endpoint: `${this.props.match.params.urlname}/more/stuff`,
      ref: 'moreStuff',
      params: { foo: 'bar' },
    };
    this.props.get(lazyQuery);
  }
}
```

### POST

```js
// Example.jsx
import * as api from 'meetup-web-platform/lib/actions/apiActionCreators';

const NEW_STUFF_REF = 'newStuff';

function mapStateToProps(state) {
  // when the POST returns, the response will be accessible in Redux state,
  // populated by an `API_RESP_SUCCESS` or `API_RESP_ERROR` action
  return {
    NEW_STUFF_REF: state.api[NEW_STUFF_REF],  
  };
}

function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
  return bindActionCreators({ post: api.post }, dispatch);
}

class Example extends React.Component {
  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
    if (nextProps[NEW_STUFF_REF]) {
      // the POST returned _something_ - maybe an error
      // you probably want to call `this.setState` or something here
    }
  }
  onSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();  // prevent full-page submit
    const postQuery = {
      endpoint: `${this.props.match.params.urlname}/new/stuff`,
      ref: NEW_STUFF_REF,
      params: this.state.formValues,  // this would be set by controlled inputs in the form
    };
    this.props.post(postQuery);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
        ...
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

#### Uploading files

API POST/PATCH endpoints that support file uploads have one additional
constraint because the file data cannot be easily JSON-serialized like `params`
in other query objects.

The standard way of encoding form data that includes file uploads is to assemble
the entire form contents into a [`FormData`
instance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/FormData), which
allows the file contents to be passed around the application as a `Blob` that
can be encoded for transmission.

To form a Query with form data, simply pass a `FormData` instance as the
`params` property

```js
// Example.jsx
import * as api from 'meetup-web-platform/lib/actions/apiActionCreators';

const NEW_FILE_STUFF = 'newFileStuff';

function mapStateToProps(state) {
  // when the POST returns, the response will be accessible in Redux state,
  // populated by an `API_RESP_SUCCESS` or `API_RESP_ERROR` action
  return {
    NEW_FILE_STUFF: state.api[NEW_FILE_STUFF],  
  };
}

function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
  return bindActionCreators({ post: api.post }, dispatch);
}

class Example extends React.Component {
  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
    if (nextProps[NEW_FILE_STUFF]) {
      // the POST returned _something_ - maybe an error
      // you probably want to call `this.setState` or something here
    }
  }
  onSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();  // prevent full-page submit
    const postQuery = {
      endpoint: `${this.props.match.params.urlname}/new/stuff`,
      ref: NEW_FILE_STUFF,
      params: new FormData(this.form),  // one stop form encoding - forces 'multipart/form-data' content type
    };
    this.props.post(postQuery);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <form
        onSubmit={this.onSubmit}
        ref={el => this.form = el}
      >
        ...
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

### PATCH

In practice, a PATCH request is just a POST by another name - use the `post`
action creator from `apiActionCreators`.

### DELETE

In practice, a DELETE request is just a GET by another name - use the `del`
action creator from `apiActionCreators`.

The response will generally be a '204 - No Content',
so you'll have to read the 'updated' value in Redux state a little more
carefully.
